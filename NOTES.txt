      Find dependency ports, check what is installed, choose between
      p5- and bsdpan- alternates

   -- Packlist.pm

      Write out the module manifest as required by ports.

   Code assumes presence of a ports tree -- prefer 'pkg rquery' 

========================================================================

   To create pkg(8) packages simply write a manifest into a working
   directory (something temporary), then feed the directory name to

      pkg register -m dirname    (to register as an installed pkg)

   or 

      pkg create -m dirname      (to create a pkg tarball)

   (Aside: you can say "pkg register -M ./+MANIFEST" <--- this should
    be taught to understand "pkg register -M -" to mean 'read from stdin'

    However you can't say "pkg create -M ./+MANIFEST" which seems
    pretty arbitrary.)

   When creating a manifest:

      output in UCL format is pretty forgiving for machine handling.

      you don't need to fill in the checksums for each file: pkg(8) will
      calculate the checksums itself

      similarly, you don't need to fill in shlibs provided/required,
      as those are automatic too.

      currently files, sym-links, multiply linked files are all listed
      under 'files' -- relies on tar dtrt.

      'categories' is pretty arbitrary: traditional use is ports
      specific.  I'm just going to use 'cpan' for BSDPAN stuff.

      'origin' is also pretty ports specific -- the category/port
      diectory name relative to $PORTSDIR.  For BSDPAN use I'm
      thinking the CPAN URL would be the best equivalent, FFR -> a
      module to allow pkg to check on CPAN for any upgrades and apply
      them as required.

   Eg.

   "origin" : "http://search.cpan.org/~nlnetlabs/Net-DNS-0.75/"

   The euivalent "www" setting should be

   "www" : "http://search.cpan.org/~nlnetlabs/Net-DNS-0.75/lib/Net/DNS.pm"

   ie. the primary docco for the module.
