      Find dependency ports, check what is installed, choose between
      p5- and bsdpan- alternates

   -- Packlist.pm

      Write out the module manifest as required by ports.

   Code assumes presence of a ports tree -- prefer 'pkg rquery' 

========================================================================

   To create pkg(8) packages simply write a manifest into a working
   directory (something temporary), then feed the directory name to

      pkg register -m dirname    (to register as an installed pkg)

   or 

      pkg create -m dirname      (to create a pkg tarball)

   (Aside: you can say "pkg register -M ./+MANIFEST" <--- this should
    be taught to understand "pkg register -M -" to mean 'read from stdin'

    However you can't say "pkg create -M ./+MANIFEST" which seems
    pretty arbitrary.)

   When creating a manifest:

      output in UCL format is pretty forgiving for machine handling.

      you don't need to fill in the checksums for each file: pkg(8) will
      calculate the checksums itself

      similarly, you don't need to fill in shlibs provided/required,
      as those are automatic too.

      currently files, sym-links, multiply linked files are all listed
      under 'files' -- relies on tar dtrt.
